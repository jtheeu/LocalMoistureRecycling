# LocalMoistureRecycling_scripts
This repository includes scripts that can be used to plot the local moisture recycling ratio as defined by Theeuwen et al. (2022). 

The scripts included are:
1. new_seasonal_figure_recycling_world.py
    This script plots the seasonal averages of the local moisture recycling ratio.
2. plot_recycling_yearly_compare_LMR.py
    This script plots the yearly averages of r1, r9, and r25. 
3. plot_comparison_link_utrack.py
    This script plots the recycling of moisture within a 1.5 degrees grid cell for both the output from UTrack and WAM2-Layers.It also plots the deviation. 
4. calculate_recycling_utrack_1.5degrees.py
    This script calculates the recycling of moisture within a 1.5 degrees grid cell.
5. calculate_recycling_r9.py
    This script calculates the local moisutre recycling ratio (r9).
